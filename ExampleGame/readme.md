# Cycle of the Simulacra
## The Example Game using both SadConsole v9 and GoRogue v3

Plot: You come to awareness at the shrine in the center of the map. The only things nearby are an alter, a dagger, a tome, and an hourglass.
 
The tome contains the instructions to create a _Simulacrum_, sentient clone, out of Snow, Slime, Blood, and Bones. You need to collect 100 units of each on the alter and place a weapon into its hand to bring it to life. You have one turn of the hourglass, or 500 turns, to complete the Simularcum. There is no mention of reward or punishment.

As your attention returns to the room, the hourglass turns by it's own volition!

| Key | Action | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arrow Keys | Move in direction | 
| A | Attack | telegraph & select squares |
| F | Feint | telegraph, but don't attack | 
| R | Rush | Telegraph, then move an additional square before damaging next round
| B | Block | take half damage, stuns attacker for one round |
| I | Inventory | Swaps the currently stored item with whichever slot makes most sense (Body or Wielded) |

## How to play

Characters have health (the player starts with 2), and they can gain additional hit points by finding Fountains littered throughout the dungeon. All characters have 1 base damage, and all weapons (except the dagger) grant an additional 1 damage. Characters can only possess three items: a wielded item, a worn item, and a stored item.

Combat is turn based. To __Attack__, Characters `Telegraph` their attack and choose the square(s) they wish to damage. Damage is dealt on the next round, after movement. Therefore, selecting to attack will automatically decide and resolve your next two turns.

In addition to attacking, a character may also __Feint__. Feinting Telegraphs, but doesn't deal damage the next round. Instead, a feinting character may reclaim their movement next round.

Characters may also __Rush__. To rush means that you are charging forwards as you attack, and therefore, after telegraphing the rush, you choose a new square to rush to, and then choose the squares that you damage. 

Characters who feel defensive may choose to __Block__. Blocking characters take half damage for a round, and if they are struck while blocking, automatically Telegraph an attack for next round, and stun their attacker for a round. 

Many enemies have special abilities which make them very difficult to fight. There are two bosses which hold magic items that may make your quest easier or harder.
